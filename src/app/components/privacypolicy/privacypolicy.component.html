                Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling our customers' personal information to others. We share customers' personal information only as described below and with Affiliates of BuiltShops PWK Holdings Private Limited that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

                <strong>Transactions involving Third Parties:</strong> We make available to you services, products, applications, or skills provided by third parties for use on or through BuiltShops Services. For example, you can bookmark products from third parties through our platform. We may also offer services or sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers' personal information related to those transactions with that third party.

            <p class="para">
                <strong>Third-Party Service Providers:</strong> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling subscriptions for products or services, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analysing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing payments, transmitting content, scoring, assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. These third-party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

            <p class="para">
                <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that BuiltShops or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

For example, if you have already bookmarked one of our products/services/products/companies, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to bookmarked the content again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers.
